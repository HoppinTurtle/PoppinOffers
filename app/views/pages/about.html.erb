<h1>About us</h1>
<p>36 year old NON tech guy. Ran into your website onemonth.com and it caught my attention. Need to build a custom solution for my wholesale liquidation business. We buy truckloads of customer return and overstock merchandise, we then process and resell online via multiple marketplaces. The system we need relates to the qauiltiy control process, inventory management and scraping data from amazon's api to prefill ebay templates and push to ebay. Similar to what a drop shipping software would do but not meant for dropshipping. Need to build very specific features to efficiently operate under one system for the most part and interact with other systems. This would be a very big project I assume (or not? no clue) but it needs to get done. I do not expect to accomplish this on my own but it would me nice to educate myself abit so I am not flying so blind during the build and hiring process. Any insight or help would be very appreciated!</p>
